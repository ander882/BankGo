Getting to some code!  

In ... I specified the directory structure, the config file and how to read it and some nomenclature.  Here I start with the first three programs (tasks).  

```
02-g-start:
start=start

025-g-start:

03-open:
start=start

05-l-start:
meme=meme
imcu=imcu
kemba=kemba
hunt=hunt
rept=rept

09-bankm-skip:
BankM=BankM
```

As these are single digit programs, they are all startup and initalization scripts.  First off is 

# 02-g-start
```
#!/bin/bash

#####
# 
# This does some global startup work
#
# Only call this once for all process!
#
#####

taskString="02 global start"

startTask "$taskString"



#####
# Instalation Stuff.  code that should only work once
# and not be destructive
#####

#Make these two directories if needed.  
#this should only happen THE VERY FIRST TIME this script is ran
# -p option is non desctructive.  Stuff in the db will not be destroyed.
mkdir -p ${CONFIG[_HOME]}/process
mkdir -p ${CONFIG[_HOME]}/db/backup


endTask "$taskScring"
```

# 025-g-start

This file is new.  It use to be part of # 02-g-start but this part is descructive.  
So it gets moved into 025.  Reason being; The new checkall program.  This program
wants to check things after a full run to check for various errors.  And this it
does not want to be descructive...

startTask "$taskScring"

######
# Startup stuff.
# This will be ran every time the whole process' are started
#####

# Go ahead and remove all files in the HOME/process directory.
# Lets start fresh

rm -rf ${CONFIG[_HOME]}/process/*



endTask "$taskScring"
```

Lets walk through this...  startTask displays a line in the console stating that it is starting.  Great.  
Then we make our non BashManager directories.  They are already there, but just in case..  Also note
the CONFIG variable that BashManager gives us.  We will be using a lot of varaibles from BashManager.

Then we remove everything in the process directory.  The process directory stores all of the intermediate
work that we do while running through the program.  Hey.  something broke?  Check the process directory to
see what happened...  Error messages also go into the process directory.

a quick endTask to display in the console, and we are done with our one time global initalization.

# 03-open:
This is new for the third version of this program.  I'm using Chrome and my chrome throws errors a lot.  
And those errors go into my console output.  Quite a nasty site.  Well I'm throwing keys to get tasks done,
so why not throw a couple of keys to open a new terminal shell and open chrome from that shell!  Now all
Chrome errors go into this new terminal and all is good.  Take a look at the code.  Our first use of xdotool
* startTask to show nice messages on the console
* throw the keys ctrl+alt+t to open up a new terminal (linux desktop keybinding)
* wait for it to open
* type in 'chromium-browser'
* wiat for Chrome to open
* * if it opens endTask and continue
* * if not, stopProcess to stop everything

# 05-l-start
Within start/endProcess I just setup some enviroment variables for thedb and /process directories.  Hmm.
There is nothing specific for each of the banks.  So maybe they should be removed?


And that is it for initalizations!  On to some web scraping!

# 09-bankm-skip
This is very new.  The BankM bank is used so little, I've added code to let it only run every third time.
