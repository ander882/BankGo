On to processing!

Now that we have scrapped our data and have it in nice files, lets start getting the data out and into our databases (2).

Here is our config file
```
20-balance:
meme=meme
imcu=imcu
kemba=kemba
hunt=hunt

22-new-trans:
meme=meme
imcu=imcu
kemba=kemba
hunt=hunt

#25-Beancount:
#meme=meme
#imcu=imcu
#kemba=kemba
#hunt=hunt
```

## 20-balance.sh
Just a quick little script to extract the current available balance from our scraped data
These are all mostly sed scripts that makes one file that has an amount in it only.

## 20-to-tsv.sh
A second 20 level script?  Hmm.  Probably should have given them different numbers...  either way this is where we get to our python scripts.
We need to take our 19 level data and further extract the correct information into a .TSV file

A note on the 19 level scripts.  Usually the last line in these scripts is 'tac'.  What a wonderful little program.  The banks give us
our transactions newest on top.  We want this reversed.  'tac' to the rescue.  With tihs one little program our 'to tsv' are much simpler.
We don't have to store what we see and spit it out in reverse.  The transaction detail is already newest on the bottom like we want.
All we have to do is read in the transaction detail line(s) and spit out one tsv line.  nothing more.  Thanks tac!

### On to a standard database format
My first two versions of BankGo had different table sizes for each of the banks...


| bank | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BankA | Date | Desc | Amnt | Fee | Balance |
| BankB | Date | Check | Desc | Amt | ? | Balance |
| BankC | Date | Desc | Amt | Balance |
BankA no longer has the fee column, but it is still in the database...

Hmmm.  Not too bad.  But if every bank had the same structure...  Things would be easier.  (?)  So I went with:


| bank | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| All | Date | Desc | Desc2 | Amnt | Balance |

I am using Description 2 for Card info and MCC info (and maybe some tag info).  The card info is nice as it shows who is spending money.  
It is the last 4 digits of the card number.  And I will talk about mcc codes later.

### Python
Thanks internet for the first 20 lines of code in each of my 20 level python scripts.  
It either sees a file and reads it, or takes in the stream and reads it.  Easy.

### BankA
Luckily BankA gives us a nice little tab seperated table of transactions already!  
Read in the lines one by one, Make the date in a better format, Add the new second description column, and spit it out.  Easy.

### BankB
Retretfully BankA was the only nice table web scrape.  BankB has more going on. the 19-BankB.out file comes in in reverse order.
So keep reading them in and do the date and right order, check for cc info and add it to description 2 field, 
and remove a funky minus character in the amount.

### BankM
Because BankM uses the 'View Page Source' and all of the transaction detail is in one long array of dictionaries (one dict for each transaction), 
the 19-BankM.sh script is funner than the rest.  
But after it, we are left with 3 description lines, Date, Balance and amount and a seperater line in the 19-BankM.out file.
Combine the 3 descriptions, fix the date, print and continue.  

### The value of bashmanager
This is the true value of a task runner.  Break things out into pieces.  Or steps.  And go through the steps.
