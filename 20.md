On to processing!

Now that we have scrapped our data and have it in nice files, lets start getting the data out and into our databases (2).

## 20-balance.sh
Just a quick little script to extract the current available balance from our scraped data
These are all mostly sed scripts that makes one file that has an amount in it only.

## 20-to-tsv.sh
A second 20 level script?  Hmm.  Probably should have given them different numbers...  either way this is where we get to our python scripts.
We need to take our 19 level data and further extract the correct information.

### On to a standard database format
My first two versions of BankGo had different table sizes for each of the banks...


| bank | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BankA | Date | Desc | Amnt | Fee | Balance |
| BankB | Date | Check | Desc | Amt | ? | Balance |
| BankC | Desc | Amt | Balance |

Hmmm.  Not too bad.  But if every bank had the same structure...  Things would be easier.  (?)  So I went with:


| bank | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| All | Date | Desc | Desc2 | Amnt | Balance |

I am using Description 2 for Card info and MCC info.  The card info is nice as it shows who is spending money.  
It is the last 4 digits of the card number.  And I will talk about mcc codes later.
