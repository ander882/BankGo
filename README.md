# BankGo
A Bank web scraper and more

This is my third version of my bank scraper!  And I need to share this with the world.  There are people that want to do the exact same things I'm doing, so...  MAKE IT PUBLIC.


Preferace:
  This is my third version of this program.  The first used puppeteer.  It is a fine piece of software.  But my first bank changed and then knew it was being used by web scraping software so it didn't work.  Instead of building a better mouse to circumvent the better mouse trap...  I went more basic.  Thus version 2 was made.  But it used node, python and bash.  Time to make things simpler and drop one of these requirements.  Bye bye node.  Nothing against you.  Version 3 now only uses Bash and Python.
