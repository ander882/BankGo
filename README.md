# BankGo
A Bank web scraper and more

This is my third version of my bank scraper!  And I need to share this with the world.  There are people that want to do the exact same things I'm doing, so...  MAKE IT PUBLIC.


## The first Version
used puppeteer.  It is a fine piece of software.  But my first bank (BankA) updated and then they knew it was being controlled by web scraping software so now it doesn't work.  So, instead of building a better mouse to circumvent the better trap...  I went more basic.

## The second version
Now my software uses node (Still works with BankB), python and bash.  Time to make things simpler and drop one of these requirements.  Bye bye node.  Nothing against you.  Dropping node also dropped the requirement of using an older version of chrome.  nice.

## The third version
Now with a third bank (BankC), I've stripped down to only using Bash and Python.  I can use any browser I wish.  Of course I will have to edit my web scraping code to work with a different browser, but the changes should be minimal.  So now I have far less requirements.  Better ease.  And now to show everyone how.
