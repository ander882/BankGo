# BankGo
A Bank web scraper and more

This is my third version of my bank scraper!  And I need to share this with the world.  There are people that want to do the exact same things I'm doing, so...  MAKE IT PUBLIC.


##The first Version
used puppeteer.  It is a fine piece of software.  But my first bank (BankA) changed and then they knew it was being used by web scraping software so it didn't work.  So, instead of building a better mouse to circumvent the better trap...  I went more basic.

##The second version
Now my software uses node (Still works with BankB), python and bash.  Time to make things simpler and drop one of these requirements.  Bye bye node.  Nothing against you.  

## The third version
Now with a third bank (BankC), Ive stripped down to only using Bash and Python.  Far less requirements.  Better ease.
