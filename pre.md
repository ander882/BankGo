## The first Version
used puppeteer. It is a fine piece of software. But my first bank (BankA) updated and then they knew it 
was being controlled by web scraping software so now it doesn't work.  Also Puppeteer made me use an older version of Chrome.
Not optional, but ok.  But I was looking toward using ANY browser I wanted and the newest.

A time before, a friend asked me to write a piece of software for him.  He wanted me to make an app to log on to a Nike web site and purchase
shoes AS SOON as they became available.  Ok, I can do that.  But in looking at this new problem, I found that people were already making
better mice for this trap.  Teams were competing against each other to buy these shoes first.  Ok.  I'm out of that...  

So, instead of using a smarter puppeteer to build a better mouse to circumvent this new bank trap... I went more basic.
Make the new bank software look just like a standard user.  Throw keys at the active window just like a keyboard does.  Lets go.

## The second version
Now my software uses node (Still works with BankB), python (throwing keys for BankA) and bash.  
Time to make things simpler and drop one of these requirements. Bye bye node. Nothing against you. 
Dropping node also dropped the requirement of using an older version of chrome. nice.

## The third version
Now with a third bank (BankC), and two different accounts in one bank... 
I've stripped down to only using Bash and Python.  Bash for web scraping now and Python for fun text processing.
I can use any browser I wish. 
Of course I will have to edit my web scraping code to work with a different browser, but the changes should be minimal. 
So now I have far less requirements. Better ease. And now to show everyone how I am doing it.
