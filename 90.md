Time to close this out.  It has been a wonderful journey of making little tools to make a whole program.

Here is the last lines to the Bashmanager config file

```
93-close:
end=end
```

We need to make a new process 'end'.  If we were to use start like we did with the 02 and 03 then this would run at the end if it 
(before scraping the banks).  
Gotta use a new process name AND use it at the end of the file for it to run at the end.

So now when I want to run only one bank I use the following code:
```
bashman -h . -p start -p BankM -p end -v
```
I'm not sure if the order of the -p arguments need to be in order or not.  Maybe bashmanager uses the order from the config file?

And that is it!  Now it is time to check the updated beancount file and make sure things are smooth...
I hope someone finds this useful.
