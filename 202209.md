# Now with a library!

  Yes!  If you are doing the same thing over and over, put it in a library.  Look in the task.d/10-scrape-lib.sh.
  
# Updates to the databases.

  Yeah, they are just .tsv files.  But now the description2 field will hold a bank key first. 
  Then other things if found (cc info, mcc info, other).
  
# A new check program.

  At this time it only checks for duplicate lines in the database(s), 
  but it has already helped find/fix an error...  More checks will come in the future.
