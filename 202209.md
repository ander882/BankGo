# Version 3 rc 2022-09.

## Now with a library!

  Yes!  If you are doing the same thing over and over, put it in a library.  Look in the task.d/10-scrape-lib.sh.
  
## Enviroment variables

  I am now using a .env file to store bank web site info and search terms.  
  This allows the individual bank files to look almost identical.  And that means moving things.  
  
  For example, level 10.  one 10-logon script calls each of the 10-bank[a|b|c|d] scripts.  
  But now that each of these scripts look VERY similiar, we can move the code all into 10-logon.
  To be done soon?  Oh yea.  I can't share that one....
  
## Updates to the databases.

  Yeah, they are just .tsv files.  But now the description2 field will hold a bank key first. 
  Then other things if found (cc info, mcc info, other).
  
  example: 'A C1234 M2345'
  * The 'A' bank
  * CC ending in 1234
  * identified with the MCC code of 2345
  * * Take a look at my mcc.py program in the util directory.  It helped me find all my frequently used codes.
  
## A new check program.

  At this time it only checks for duplicate lines in the database(s), 
  but it has already helped find/fix an error...  More checks will come in the future.
