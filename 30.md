Getting to the end of things...

The 30 level config file:
```
30-backup-db:
meme=meme
imcu=imcu
kemba=kemba
hunt=hunt

35-update-db:
meme=meme
imcu=imcu
kemba=kemba
hunt=hunt
```

## 30-backup-db
Does as it says.  But in the db/backup directory there is a ver.txt containing a 4 digit number.  The script reads that number and then increments it.
With that number, we copy the tsv file from db into the db/backup directory WITH the version number appended to is.  
This script will also copy up the beancount file with the same number added on.  So in the db/backup directory, you will see filenames like this:
```
0004-2022.bc
BankA.tsv
BankC.tsv
```
Yes...  I could have used a simple versioning control program like rcs or something more powerful.  But these are text files.  small ones.  
maybe even zip them?  Either way, small simple.  And after 3+ years, I have not yet had to use a backup.

## 35-update-db:
Now that we have backed up the db.  We can now update it.  22-new-trans has given us a file with ONLY the new transaction.  
25-Beancount has given us a new file wint ONLY the new beancount transactions.  So simply use cat to append them to our existing database.

And that is basically it!  There is only one more program left but other than that, it is manual work now with the beancount file.  
Open it up and make sure transactions use the correct account and make sure the transactions are in the right group.  Whoopie!
